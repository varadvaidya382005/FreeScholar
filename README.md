# Scholarship Application Platform for Students Studying Outside Their Home State

## Overview
This platform is designed to help students who are residents of one state, such as Maharashtra, but are pursuing education in another state across India. These students often face challenges in accessing local scholarships from their current state of study. To address this, our centralized platform connects students with scholarship opportunities provided by their home state government.

## How It Works
By collaborating with both the home state government and the educational institutions in the student’s current state of study, our platform simplifies and streamlines the scholarship application process.
